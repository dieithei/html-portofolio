<p>Really really relly a masterpiece. The story is so good. It talks about the mainn character (Chung Myung) who reincarnated after death for fighting the demon king.
    In his new life, he want to take care of his new generation of Mount Hua Sect to become the greatest sect in the world.</p>
<li><h3>Solo Levelling</h3></li>
